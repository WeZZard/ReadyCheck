# ADA Tracer Specification (MVP)

This document specifies the behavior and requirements of the ADA Tracer component (instrumentation backend + control plane). It does not define the event schema (see `docs/specs/TRACE_SCHEMA.md`), but the tracer must emit events conforming to that schema.

## 1. Scope and Goals
- Provide full-coverage function tracing for developer-owned macOS targets (Apple Silicon preferred) as the first MVP platform.
- Emit high-fidelity `FunctionCall` and `FunctionReturn` events with ABI-relevant registers and a shallow stack snapshot to the ADA Trace Format (ATF) using the V4 Protobuf schema.
- Prioritize performance and completeness for agentic debugging workflows.

## 2. Non-Goals (MVP)
- Hardened Runtime, system apps, or Mac App Store binaries.
- Interactive breakpoints/stepping.
- Windows support.

## 3. Definitions
- Tracer: Instrumentation backend + control plane that attaches/spawns, installs hooks, collects events, applies backpressure and overflow handling, and writes ATF.
- Full coverage: By default, hook all resolvable functions in the target program and all currently loaded—and subsequently loaded—dynamic libraries (DSOs).
- ATF: ADA Trace Format; directory containing length-delimited Protobuf `Event` stream and indexes (indexes may be minimal in MVP).

## 4. Platform and Mechanisms
- macOS (MVP):
  - Mechanism: Frida Gum native (C/C++) hooks with a shared-memory ring buffer for hot-path logging.
  - Control plane: Rust process responsible for injection/attach, shared-memory setup, draining, encoding to ATF, and metrics.
  - Timestamps: Monotonic (mach_absolute_time) converted to ns.
  - Requirements: Dev/debug targets with entitlements that allow injection/JIT as needed.
  - Function identity: assign `moduleId` (small int per image) and `functionId = (moduleId << 32) | symbolIndex` (dense ordinal per image). Persist module UUID→moduleId mapping in manifest; record function tables’ hash.
- Linux (post-MVP parity):
  - Mechanism: eBPF uprobes/uretprobes (libbpf CO-RE) with perf ring buffer.
  - Control plane: Rust.

## 5. Functional Requirements (FR)
- FR-001 (MUST) Full-coverage by default
  - On start, install hooks on all resolvable functions in the main binary and all loaded DSOs; attach hooks for DSOs loaded later during runtime.
  - No allowlist is required to achieve coverage. Optional exclusions may exist but are off by default.
- FR-002 (MUST) Event emission
  - For each hooked function: emit a `FunctionCall` on entry and a `FunctionReturn` on exit per `TRACE_SCHEMA.md`.
- FR-003 (MUST) ABI registers
  - Capture only ABI-relevant argument registers on call and return-value registers on return; name keys by arch (e.g., `X0`, `RDI`, `RAX`).
- FR-004 (MUST) Shallow stack snapshot
  - Capture a shallow stack window from SP on entry. Default 128 bytes; configurable 0–512 bytes. Avoid reading below SP.
- FR-005 (MUST) Dynamic module tracking
  - Detect and hook functions from modules loaded after startup; avoid duplicates.
- FR-006 (MUST) Symbol strategy
  - Resolve function symbols from the main binary and DSOs. For inline/non-exported sites, coverage is best-effort; record IP always; symbolize offline where needed.
- FR-007 (MUST) Durable output
  - Write a length-delimited V4 Protobuf stream (`events.bin`) and a minimal `trace.json` manifest with OS/arch/start/end; tolerate process crashes (best-effort flush).
- FR-008 (SHOULD) Reentrancy guard
  - Prevent tracer logging from re-entering hot APIs being traced (e.g., allocator) to avoid recursion.
- FR-009 (SHOULD) Config interface
  - CLI/API to set output path, stack window size, optional excludes, sampling rate, and max depth.
- FR-010 (MUST) Key-symbol lane
  - Accept live-updatable per-module key-symbol selections with an adaptive container per module: choose dense bitset for small/dense symbol spaces, Roaring bitmap for clustered IDs, or a cacheline-friendly flat hash set (SwissTable-style) for sparse/large spaces. Membership checks must be O(1) on the hot path. Version and hash recorded in manifest; updates via RCU pointer swap.
- FR-011 (MUST) Platform limitation pre-check
  - Before attempting to spawn or attach, detect if target is a system binary or otherwise protected by platform security features.
  - Provide immediate user-friendly feedback without attempting doomed operations.
- FR-012 (MUST) Error message clarity
  - Error messages must distinguish between:
    - Fixable permission issues (e.g., missing Developer Tools permission)
    - Unfixable platform constraints (e.g., system binary protection)
  - Use plain language appropriate for developers, not kernel-level diagnostics.

## 6. Performance and Scale Requirements (PR)
- PR-001 (MUST) Hook coverage startup time
  - On an Apple Silicon dev machine (M3-class), installing hooks for ~5k symbols must complete in ≤ 3 seconds for the main binary; overall startup including DSOs ≤ 8 seconds under typical app loads.
- PR-002 (MUST) Sustained throughput
  - Sustain ≥ 5 million events/second across an 8‑core dev machine at default settings (trace‑all, stack window ≤ 128 bytes) with < 1% drop rate. On a per‑core basis, sustain ≥ 0.6–3.0 million events/second depending on workload (see §6.1 throughput budgeting). Defaults should be chosen to meet this bar on typical Apple Silicon dev hardware.
- PR-003 (MUST) Overhead bound
  - Add ≤ 10% CPU overhead on representative workloads at default settings (trace-all, 128-byte stack) when excluding extremely hot runtime symbols (see PR-005).
- PR-004 (MUST) Latency
  - Median end-to-end encode-to-disk latency ≤ 25 ms; 99th percentile ≤ 250 ms.
- PR-005 (SHOULD) Hot site policy
  - Document known pathological symbols (e.g., `objc_msgSend`, allocators) and provide guidance to re-run with targeted allowlists/excludes when traces exceed declared budgets.

### 6.1 Throughput budgeting (informative)
- Approximate event rate given CPU frequency, average cycles-per-call, and core count:
  - Calls/sec per core ≈ `freq_hz / cycles_per_call`
  - Events/sec per core (enter+leave) ≈ `2 × (freq_hz / cycles_per_call)`
  - Events/sec (N cores) ≈ `N × 2 × (freq_hz / cycles_per_call)`
- Example (3 GHz core):
  - 2,000 cycles/call → ≈ 3.0 M events/s per core; 8 cores → ≈ 24 M events/s
  - 10,000 cycles/call → ≈ 0.6 M events/s per core; 8 cores → ≈ 4.8 M events/s
- Planning guidance
  - Index lane should aim to sustain multi‑million events/sec across typical dev hardware (e.g., 5–25 M events/s depending on workload).
  - Detail lane must be windowed and gated (flight recorder) to keep aggregate throughput within storage budgets.
  - Size ring buffers and WAL throughput for the target peak rate R and burst window Tb (see BP‑004), using the above model to choose conservative defaults.

## 7. Backpressure and Overflow (BP)
- BP-001 (MUST) Sharded rings and priority lane
  - Use per-thread SPSC rings (L1) feeding an MPSC drain (L2). Provide a must-not-drop lane for crash/signal diagnostics.
- BP-002 (MUST) Watermarks and bounded spill (no sampling)
  - Enforce high/low watermarks per ring. Optionally use a single, preallocated spill ring for short bursts with a hard cap. Do not apply random sampling or quality shedding.
- BP-003 (MUST) Drop policy and accounting
  - If overflow persists, drop-oldest on the lowest-priority lane only, and record explicit reason codes (e.g., ring full, encoder lag). Maintain bounded latency.
- BP-004 (MUST) Capacity planning
  - Support configuration of target peak rate (Rp) and burst window (Tb). Pre-size and pre-fault rings accordingly; document computed event capacity K = floor(R / s).

## 8. Throughput and Durability (TD)
- TD-001 (MUST) Compact event layout
  - Use IDs over strings, 32-bit address deltas from module base, varint timestamp deltas, presence bitmaps for ABI registers, and cap/disable stack snapshots (default 128B, configurable 0–512B).
- TD-002 (MUST) Memory and CPU efficiency
  - Cacheline-align records, single-writer/single-reader rings, batch drain, and pin the drain thread. Pre-fault and mlock rings; consider huge pages where available.
- TD-003 (MUST) Write-ahead logging
  - Append to preallocated segments with configurable flush policy: off, interval_ms, bytes, or on segment rotate. Avoid synchronous fsync on every batch; expose a safe mode separately.
- TD-004 (SHOULD) Offline transcode
  - Optionally write compact fixed records to WAL and transcode to Protobuf offline to decouple hot-path cost.
- TD-005 (MUST) Two-lane persistence
  - Maintain an always-on compact index lane (time, functionId, tid, kind) and a windowed detail lane (regs/stack) controlled by triggers and key-symbol membership. Record window metadata (pre/post roll, triggers, key-symbol version).

## 9. Observability and Metrics (OB)
- OB-001 (MUST) Metrics
  - Expose: events/sec, drops/sec with reasons, buffer fill %, hook counts, attach time, encoder latency, process CPU/mem.
- OB-002 (SHOULD) Diagnostics
  - Optional verbose logs for attach/hook operations, module arrivals, and failure reasons.

## 10. Configuration and Interfaces (CF)
- CF-001 (MUST) CLI
  - `spawn <path> [-- args...]`, `attach <pid>`, `--out <dir>`, `--stack-bytes N`, `--exclude module[,module...]`.
- CF-002 (SHOULD) JSON-RPC
  - Control plane API allowing remote trigger of spawn/attach and configuration; returns trace directory path and metrics snapshot.
- CF-003 (MUST) Defaults
  - Full coverage ON; stack window 128 bytes; sampling OFF; excludes NONE.
 - CF-004 (MUST) Flight recorder mode
   - Configure always-on index lane and detailed window capture with `--pre-roll-sec`, `--post-roll-sec`, and triggers (`--trigger symbol=foo`, `--trigger p99=function:bar>50ms`, `--trigger crash`, `--trigger time=10:30-10:45`). Triggers are armable without restart when supported.
- CF-005 (MUST) Key-symbol updates
  - Accept moduleId→container blobs (bitset/roaring/hash) over CLI/API to update key symbols live (double-buffer + RCU swap), without restart. Manifest records container type, version, and hash.

### 10.1 Permissions & Preflight (new)
- CF-006 (MUST) Preflight diagnostics API
  - Provide `/diagnose` (and CLI `diagnose <path|pid>`) that runs capability checks and returns a machine-readable report with ordered remediation steps.
  - Keep user-facing messages high-level; detailed procedures and platform terms are defined in `docs/specs/PERMISSIONS_AND_ENVIRONMENT.md`.
- CF-007 (MUST) Deterministic error-to-action mapping
  - Map common failures to exact remediations: Developer Tools permission, sudo recommendation, code-signing/library validation issues, JIT allowance, protected/SIP processes.
- CF-008 (MUST) Consent and guardrails
  - Never auto re-sign binaries; require explicit user confirmation for commands that alter code signatures or entitlements. Do not suggest SIP relaxations.

## 11. Reliability and Safety (RL)
- RL-001 (MUST) Crash-tolerance
  - Best-effort close/flush of trace on target/crash or tracer termination; manifest records abnormal termination.
- RL-002 (MUST) Stability
  - Instruction cache flush and thread-suspend semantics handled by Frida Gum; ensure multi-thread safe hook installation.
- RL-003 (MUST) Reentrancy and recursion limits
  - Guard against logging recursion; implement per-thread flags or TLS as needed.

## 12. Security and Permissions (SC)
- SC-001 (MUST) macOS entitlements
  - Document required entitlements (`get-task-allow`, `cs.disable-library-validation`, `cs.allow-jit`) for dev targets.
- SC-002 (MUST) Process boundaries
  - Only attach to processes owned by the user; deny privilege escalation.
- SC-003 (MUST) Platform limitation detection
  - Detect and report platform-specific limitations before attempting operations. See `docs/specs/PLATFORM_LIMITATIONS.md` for details.
- SC-004 (MUST) System binary handling
  - On macOS with SIP enabled, detect system binaries and provide user-friendly error messages explaining the limitation.
  - SHALL NOT attempt to attach to system binaries in protected paths.
  - SHALL NOT require or suggest disabling System Integrity Protection.
- SC-005 (MUST) Clear limitation communication
  - Distinguish between fixable permission issues and unfixable platform security constraints in error messages.
  - Provide platform-appropriate guidance without suggesting security-compromising workarounds.

## 13. Data Contract (DC)
- DC-001 (MUST) Schema compliance
  - Every event written must conform to `docs/specs/TRACE_SCHEMA.md` V4.
- DC-002 (MUST) Time base
  - Use monotonic clocks (mach time) for timestamps; encode as `google.protobuf.Timestamp` after conversion.
- DC-003 (SHOULD) Index stubs
  - Provide minimal indexes if feasible (e.g., time range, counts) to accelerate later queries.

## 14. Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
- A1: Full-coverage default
  - On a dev build of a sample app with ~5k exported/resolvable symbols, tracer installs hooks without user-provided allowlist; subsequent DSOs are detected and hooked.
- A2: Event integrity
  - Matched entry/return pairs for hooked functions with ABI registers present; stack bytes non-empty when configured > 0.
- A3: Performance
  - Meets PR-001..PR-004 on Apple Silicon dev hardware.
- A4: Backpressure behavior
  - Under synthetic overload, tracer maintains bounded latency using ring watermarks. If drops occur, they follow the drop-oldest policy with reason codes. No sampling or quality shedding is applied.
- A5: Output validity
  - Produces an ATF directory with length-delimited `Event` stream; passes a validator for schema compliance.
 - A6: Flight recorder
   - With Wpre/Wpost configured and a trigger fired, the trace contains full-detail windows around the trigger while the remainder of the run persists only the index lane. Mode and window parameters are recorded in the manifest.

## 15. Test Plan Outline
- TP-001 Coverage startup test: measure hook count and time-to-hook on sample app + DSOs.
- TP-002 Throughput test: synthetic call generator to drive ≥ 100k events/sec; verify drop rate and latency.
- TP-003 Stability test: long-run (30–60 min) with mixed workloads; verify no deadlocks/crashes; metrics bounded.
- TP-004 Crash test: induced crash (signal) while tracing; verify best-effort flush and manifest.
- TP-005 Reentrancy test: instrument allocator hotspots; verify guards prevent recursion collapse.

## 17. Open Issues
- OI-001: Default exclude list for known pathological hot symbols (while keeping policy “trace-all by default”).
- OI-002: Portable index format for ATF (beyond MVP).
- OI-003: Dynamic symbol resolution cost vs. precomputed symbol caches.
