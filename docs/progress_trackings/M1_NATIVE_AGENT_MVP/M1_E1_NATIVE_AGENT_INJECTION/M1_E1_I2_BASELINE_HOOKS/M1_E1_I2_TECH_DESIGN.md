# Tech Design — M1 E1 I2 Baseline Hooks

## Objective

Install a deterministic set of hooks from the native agent and emit index events into the ring buffer with TLS reentrancy guard.

## Design

- Use existing `frida_agent.c`:
  - TLS for reentrancy; thread id; call depth
  - Hook the following functions in the main module of the process:
    - test_cli functions: `fibonacci`, `process_file`, `calculate_pi`, `recursive_function`
    - test_runloop functions: `simulate_network`, `monitor_file`, `dispatch_work`, `signal_handler`, `timer_callback`
  - Emit `IndexEvent` on enter/leave; capture minimal ABI registers and optional 128B stack window (guarded)
- Keep small set in MVP; reserve full coverage to a later epic.

## Shared Memory

- Open SHM via `shared_memory_open_unique(role, pid, session_id)` using ids provided by loader.
  - `pid` and `session_id` is grabbed from the host process pid.
- Fail fast if ids mismatch or SHM open fails; surface clear error via controller.

## Out of Scope

- Dynamic module tracking; symbol table scanning; key-symbol lane.
