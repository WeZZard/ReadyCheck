## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|

| ABA problem in SPSC queues | High | Low | Monotonic counters, careful ordering |
| Thread limit too low | Medium | Low | Make MAX_THREADS configurable |
| TLS not portable | Medium | Low | Fallback to manual lookup |
| Memory ordering bugs | High | Medium | ThreadSanitizer, careful review |

## Notes

- This is THE critical iteration that fixes the shared ring buffer problem
- Must ensure true SPSC semantics per thread
- Cache-line alignment crucial for performance
- Memory ordering must be explicitly correct
- Foundation for all subsequent per-thread operations

## Dependencies

### Depends On:
- M1_E1_I1: Shared Memory Setup (complete)

### Depended By:
- M1_E1_I3: Ring Buffer Core (needs lane structure)
- M1_E1_I5: Thread Registration (needs registry)
- M1_E1_I6: Ring Pool Swap (needs lanes)
- M1_E2_I1: Drain Thread (needs registry to iterate)
- M1_E2_I2: Per-Thread Drain (needs thread lanes)
