## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Signal Race Conditions**
   - Risk: Multiple signals arriving simultaneously
   - Mitigation: Atomic flags, single shutdown execution
   - Verification: Concurrent signal stress tests

2. **Data Loss During Shutdown**
   - Risk: Events in flight not persisted
   - Mitigation: Proper flush sequence, memory ordering
   - Verification: Data integrity tests

3. **Deadlock on Shutdown**
   - Risk: Threads waiting on each other
   - Mitigation: Lock-free design, timeout mechanisms
   - Verification: Stress tests with thread sanitizer

4. **Incomplete Drain**
   - Risk: Drain thread doesn't complete
   - Mitigation: Wakeup mechanism, timeout handling
   - Verification: Drain completion tests

## Performance Targets

### Latency Requirements
- Signal handler: < 1 microsecond
- Thread stop: < 10 microseconds per thread
- Buffer flush: < 1 millisecond per thread
- Total shutdown: < 100 milliseconds (64 threads)
- File sync: < 50 milliseconds

### Throughput Requirements
- Support 1M events/sec during shutdown
- Drain at least 100MB/sec during final flush
- Handle 64 concurrent threads

### Resource Usage
- No memory allocation in signal handler
- Minimal CPU overhead during normal operation
- No busy-wait loops during shutdown

## Dependencies

### Required from Previous Iterations
- M1_E2_I2: Per-thread drain mechanism
- M1_E2_I5: Duration timer for cancellation
- M1_E1_I1: ThreadRegistry for thread management
- M1_E1_I2: Ring buffer flush capability

### External Dependencies
- POSIX signals (signal.h)
- Atomic operations (stdatomic.h)
- Thread synchronization (pthread.h)
- File operations (unistd.h, fcntl.h)

## Acceptance Criteria

### User-Visible Behavior
- [ ] Ctrl+C cleanly exits the tracer
- [ ] SIGTERM handled gracefully
- [ ] Shutdown summary printed to stderr
- [ ] No data loss on shutdown
- [ ] Exit status 0 on clean shutdown

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] All threads stop accepting events
- [ ] All buffers fully flushed
- [ ] Files properly synced with fsync
- [ ] Timer cancelled if active
- [ ] Resources properly cleaned up
- [ ] Memory properly freed

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Shutdown completes in < 100ms
- [ ] No performance impact during normal operation
- [ ] Signal handling < 1 microsecond
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

## Notes for Implementation

### Memory Ordering Guidelines
- Use `memory_order_release` when setting shutdown flags
- Use `memory_order_acquire` when checking shutdown state
- Use `memory_order_acq_rel` for counters
- Document all ordering decisions

### Error Handling Strategy
- Signal handler must not allocate memory
- Use pre-allocated error messages
- Fall back to forced shutdown on timeout
- Log errors to stderr before exit

### Testing Strategy
- Test each phase independently
- Verify memory ordering with thread sanitizer
- Use valgrind for memory leak detection
- Stress test with maximum thread count

## Timeline Summary

**Day 1**: Signal handler infrastructure, shutdown manager, thread stop mechanism
**Day 2**: Buffer flush, drain integration, timer cancellation
**Day 3**: System integration, summary output, performance testing

Total Estimated Time: 24 hours
Confidence Level: High (well-defined requirements)
Risk Level: Medium (signal handling complexity)
