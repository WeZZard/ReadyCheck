## Notes and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Single drain thread**: Simpler than multiple, sufficient for v1
2. **Round-robin default**: Fair and predictable
3. **Configurable polling**: Balance CPU vs latency
4. **Batch processing**: Amortize overhead

### Future Enhancements
1. Multiple drain threads with partitioning
2. Priority-based scheduling
3. Backpressure mechanisms
4. Dynamic tuning based on workload
5. Advanced monitoring and alerts

### Implementation Tips
1. Start with simplest working version
2. Add fairness after basic polling works
3. Optimize only after correctness proven
4. Use extensive logging during development
5. Test with various workload patterns
