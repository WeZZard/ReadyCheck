## Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Example reveals ADA bug | High | Test thoroughly before documenting |
| Overhead exceeds targets | Medium | Provide sampling alternatives |
| Platform differences | Medium | Test on both Linux and macOS |
| Complex examples confuse users | Low | Start with simplest cases |

## Dependencies
- M1_E1: Agent injection working
- M1_E2: Index pipeline operational
- M1_E3: Metrics and backpressure functional
- M1_E4: Analysis tools complete
- M1_E5_I1-I3: Previous documentation done

## Success Metrics
- All examples execute without errors
- Test suite passes 100%
- Documentation coverage 100%
- User can follow examples independently
- Overhead within specified limits

## Notes
- Focus on clarity over complexity
- Each example should teach one concept
- Provide complete, runnable code
- Include expected output for validation
- Test on fresh environment
